# Project-RFID-System-for-Apartment-Parking
Creation using a sensor servo to detect guards and lift the barrier to allow passage. By applying it to the ESP32+ board in using the Arduino language to write system designs.
# Explain:
- Materials
RFID : ( Radio Frequency Identification ) Electronic data collection system
is based on electromagnetic waves instead of physical contact.
It is the use of
radio waves as a carrier wave to communicate information. RFID tags are
electronic tags (RFID Tag) that can be read through radio waves from a distance
tail to detect, track and record information attached to the tag.
